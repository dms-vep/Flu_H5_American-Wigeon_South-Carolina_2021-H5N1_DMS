# Define how to compute functional scores. Each key is a selection experiment.
# A global epistasis model is used to get mutational effects for each selection.
# Recommended naming of selection experiments is:
#   <library>-<post-selection sample date as YYMMDD>-<description>-<replicate>
# Each selection experiment should in turn provide the following keys:
#  - `post_selection_sample`: sample after selection (eg, infection of cells)
#  - `pre_selection_sample`: sample pre selection (eg, initial variant frequencies)
#  - `func_score_params`: parameters for computing functional scores
#  - `global_epistasis_params`: parameters for fitting global epistasis model

#  - `title`: title of plot. Will be suffixed with "(latent phenotype)" or ("functional score)"
#  - `legend`: legend added to plot

# Define some defaults for each condition, used via the merge (<<) operator.

    Interactive plot of the effects of mutations. Negative values indicated deleterious mutations,
    positive values indicate beneficial mutations for the measured phenotype.

    Use the site zoom bar at the top to zoom in on specific sites. The line plot shows a summary
    statistic indicating the effects of mutations at each site. The heat map shows the effects of
    individual mutations, with parental amino-acid identities indicated by x and gray
    indicating non-measured mutations.

    You can mouse over points to get details about individual measurements, include measurements
    in individual selection experiments.

    The options at the bottom of the plot let you modify the display, such as by selecting how
    many different variants a mutation must be seen in to be shown (*minimum times_seen*),
    how many different experimental selections the mutation was measured in
    (*minimum n_selections*), what site summary statistic to show, etc.

    The *minimum max of effect* at site is useful to select the sites where mutations have
    the most positive functional effects.
