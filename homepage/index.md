## About
This website contains interactive figures and detailed numerical results from [pseudovirus deep mutational scanning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001) experiments that measure the effects of all mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) of the 2.3.4.4b clade strain A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/USDA-000345-001/2021 (H5N1) on several key molecular phenotypes.
This study was led by Bernadeta Dadonaite in the Bloom lab.

The links in the boxes above take you to detailed interactive plots or descriptions of different aspects of the study.
For any easy-to-use high-level view of the results, see the [summary](summary){target="_self"} of how mutations affect all phenotypes.
But to delve into the data in more detail, also click on the boxes above for each individual phenotypes.

You can also look at details on the full [computational pipeline](pipeline_information){target="_self"}, as well as looking at the underlying code [on GitHub](https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS).

Note that the experiments use [single-cycle replicative pseudoviruses that can be safely studied at biosafety-level 2](experiments_and_biosafety){target="_self"}.
