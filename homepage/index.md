## This is the fancy homepage made with VitePress
Building this homepage requires some manual customization of the Markdown files in the `./homepage` subdirectory of your repo.
See [the instructions on building a VitePress homepage](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3/blob/main/homepage/README.md) for more details.

To see the less fancy documentation automatically build by the pipeline, see the [Appendix](/appendix){target="_self"}.
