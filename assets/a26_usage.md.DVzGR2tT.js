The <code>x</code>&#39;s indicate the amino-acid identity in the parental HA strain, light gray indicates mutations that were not measured, and dark gray indicates mutations that are filtered out by one of the interactive sliders at the bottom of the plot. If you mouseover points, you can also see the measurement in each individual library, which provides a sense of the reproducibility between experiments.</li><li>The options at the bottom of the plot allow you to adjust what is displayed. For instance, the <em>times_seen</em> slider filters for only mutations seen in at least that many unique variants per-library; larger values will generally give more accurate measurements. Similarly, you can filter by how many different experimental selections the mutation was measured in or the standard deviation (<em>std</em>) across measurements. You can also show only mutations that have at least some minimal cell entry into a2,3 or a2,6 sialic acid cells, or at least one of those (<em>best_effect</em>). Those sliders are useful for making sure you are showing mutations that are good for entry in at least one cell line in addition to having a large difference between cell lines. You can also select to only show mutations accessible by some number of mutations to the codon in the parental sequence (eg, only accessible by single-nucleotide mutations), or floor the measurements at zero to show / not show mutations that decrease as well as increase a2,6 sialic acid usage.</li></ul><h2 id="numerical-values-of-mutation-effects" tabindex="-1">Numerical values of mutation effects <a class="header-anchor" href="#numerical-values-of-mutation-effects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Numerical values of mutation effects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The numerical data plotted on this page are available in <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/results/func_effect_diffs/SA26_vs_SA23_entry_diffs.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this CSV file</a>.
