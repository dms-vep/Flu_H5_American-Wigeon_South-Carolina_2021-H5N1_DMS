Standard 293 cells lack CMAH enzyme and therefore contain only N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) on their surface. Cells expressing CMAH modify the NeuAc to form N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) during glycan biosynthesis. Some mammals, including humans (from which 293 cells are derived), have lost CMAH enzyme expression while others retain it. Most influenza isolates preferentially bind glycans terminating in NeuAc, however, some strains are known to bind NeuGc.
