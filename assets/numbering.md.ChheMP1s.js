There are historical reasons for these different numbering schemes (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229193/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for a partial explanation).</p><p>Click <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/data/site_numbering_map.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here for a file</a> that intra-converts the various numbering schemes for the H5 HA used in our experiments (the sequence of that HA protein is <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/results/gene_sequence/protein.fasta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>). The different numbering schemes in that file are as follows:</p><ul><li><em>sequential_site</em>: sequential 1, 2, ... numbering of the <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/results/gene_sequence/protein.fasta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">H5 HA protein</a> starting with 1 at the N-terminal methionine.</li><li><em>reference_site</em>: numbering using the widely used H3 numbering scheme, which puts sites into alignment with the mature ectodomain of the H3 subtype HA. Because H3 was the first HA studied in detail using structural methods, this is the most widely used scheme and all of the interactive plots on this webpage use this numbering scheme for the default site number.</li><li><em>reference_H1_site</em>: numbering using the H1 numbering scheme which puts sites into alignment with the mature ectodomain of the H1 subtype HA.</li><li><em>mature_H5_site</em>: numbering with 1 starting with the first amino acid of the mature H5 HA ectodomain (after cleavage of the signal peptide) and then continuing sequentially. Sites in the signal peptide get negative numbers.</li><li><em>HA1_HA2_H5_site</em>: sequential numbering as for the <em>sequential_site</em> scheme but starting with 1 for the HA1 domain, and then starting again with 1 for the HA2 domain.</li></ul><p><strong>All of the plots and files here use the H3 numbering scheme</strong> (the <em>reference_site</em> column in <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/data/site_numbering_map.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the CSV</a>) for what is referred to as &quot;site&quot;, but when you mouse over points on the interactive plots, you will also be shown the site number in the other numbering schemes.</p>',5),s=[a];function o(h,m,u,l,c,_){return n(),t("div",null,s)}const b=e(r,[["render",o]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
