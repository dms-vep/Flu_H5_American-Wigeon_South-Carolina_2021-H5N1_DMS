The height of each line summarizes the total escape caused by mutations at each site using the <em>site escape statistic</em> specified by the interactive options at the bottom of the plot.</li><li>The heatmaps then show how each individual mutation affects each measured phenotype. The <code>x</code>&#39;s indicate the amino-acid identity in the parental HA strain, light gray indicates mutations that were not measured, and dark gray indicates mutations that are filtered out by one of the interactive sliders at the bottom of the plot (eg, they have a very negative effect on cell entry). You can mouse over any of the points for details.</li><li>The options at the bottom of the plot allow you to interactively adjust what is displayed. For instance, the <em>minimum mutation entry in 293T cells</em> only shows mutations with at least some minimal cell entry function (and grays out mutations that are more deleterious). You can also select to only show mutations accessible by some number of mutations to the codon in the parental sequence (eg, only accessible by single-nucleotide mutations), or floor the escape at zero to show / not show &quot;negative&quot; escape values.</li></ul><p>HA genes are numbering various different ways; see <a href="./numbering.html">here</a> for an explanation of the numbering scheme used here.</p><h2 id="numerical-summary-of-mutation-effects" tabindex="-1">Numerical summary of mutation effects <a class="header-anchor" href="#numerical-summary-of-mutation-effects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Numerical summary of mutation effects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The numerical data plotted on this page are available in <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/results/summaries/phenotypes.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this CSV file</a>.
