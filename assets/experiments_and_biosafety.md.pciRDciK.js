Pseudotyping is a <a href="https://blog.addgene.org/viral-vectors-101-pseudotyping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">widely used and safe method</a> to study viral entry proteins, since the pseudoviruses can only undergo a single cycle of infection and therefore pose no risk of transmission or replication in humans or any other animals. For this reason, they provide as safe way to study mutations to proteins from even potential pandemic viruses like H5N1 influenza at biosafety level 2.</p><p>See the paper describing this study (<strong>In progress, add link when posted to bioRxiv</strong>) for more details.</p>',4),o=[i];function r(d,p,l,h,_,c){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const y=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,y as default};
