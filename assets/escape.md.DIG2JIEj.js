The black lines show the average across sera for different animals, and the gray lines show escape for individual animals. The escape at a site is quantified using the site summary statistic specified by the interactive option at the bottom of the plot (eg, sum or mean effect of mutations at a site).</li><li>The heatmaps then show how each individual mutation affects each measured phenotype. The <code>x</code>&#39;s indicate the amino-acid identity in the parental HA strain, light gray indicates mutations that were not measured, and dark gray indicates mutations that are filtered out by one of the interactive sliders at the by one of the interactive sliders at the bottom of the plot (eg, they have a very negative effect on cell entry). You can mouse over any of the points. You can mouse over any of the heatmap cells for details.</li><li>The options at the bottom of the plot allow you to interactively adjust what is displayed. For instance, the <em>minimum mutation entry in 293T cells</em> only shows mutations with at least some minimal cell entry function (and grays out mutations that are more deleterious). You can also select to only show mutations accessible by some number of mutations to the codon in the parental sequence (eg, only accessible by single -nucleotide mutations), or floor the escape at zero to show / not show &quot;negative&quot; escape values.</li></ul><h2 id="numerical-values-of-escape" tabindex="-1">Numerical values of escape <a class="header-anchor" href="#numerical-values-of-escape" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Numerical values of escape&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For per-serum escape values, see <a href="https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/blob/main/results/summaries/all_sera_escape_per_antibody_escape.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this CSV file</a>.</p><h2 id="detailed-plots-for-each-sera" tabindex="-1">Detailed plots for each sera <a class="header-anchor" href="#detailed-plots-for-each-sera" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Detailed plots for each sera&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See the more detailed results for escape from each individual serum, look <a href="/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/appendix.html" target="_self">here</a> under the <em>Antibody/serum escape</em> section.</p>',6);function u(p,f,d,_,b,v){const o=e("Altair"),i=e("Figure");return l(),n("div",null,[h,a(i,{caption:"Interactive plot showing effects of mutations on escape from serum neutralization"},{default:r(()=>[a(o,{showShadow:!0,"spec-url":"htmls/all_sera_escape_overlaid.html"})]),_:1}),m])}const w=s(c,[["render",u]]);export{g as __pageData,w as default};
