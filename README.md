# Deep mutational scanning of H5 using a barcoded lentiviral platform
Study by Bernadeta Dadonaite, Ariana Nagainis, and Jesse Bloom.

### Library design
The design of the mutant library is contained in [./library_design/](library_design).
That design is not part of the pipeline but contains code that must be run separately to create primers for saturating H5 mutagenesis.
