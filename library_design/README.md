# H5 deep mutational scanning library design

This sub-folder contains mutations that were designed to be included in this H5 library. The library was ordered from Twist Biosciences. Twist library was designed to have all possible mutations in the H5 except for some stop codons. 

`pH2rU3_ForInd_H5_H5N1_American_Wigeon_genscript_T7_CMV_ZsGT2APurR.gb` contains the plasmid map for H5 sequence in inducible lentiviral backbone used in deep mutational scanning.  

`3405_HDM_N1_native_H5N1_turkey_Indiana.gb` contains A/turkey/Indiana/22-003707-003/2022 strain neuraminidase sequence in expression plasmid.

`HDM_H5_American_Wigeon.gb` expression plasmid for codon optimized H5 HA from A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/USDA-000345-001/2021 strain.

`29_HDM_VSV_G.gb` contains sequence for VSV-G expression plasmid.

`3137_pH2rU3_ForInd_mCherry_CMV_ZsGT2APurR.gb` contains lentivirus backbone used to construct deep mutational scanning libraries which codes for mCherry gene.

`3068_ForInd_mC_BCs_pool1.gb` and `3069_ForInd_mC_BCs_pool2.gb` contain plasmid maps for barcoded non-neutralizable standards. These were pooled equimolarly for experiments.

`2727_pHAGE6-wtCMV-Luc2-BrCr1-ZsGreen-W-1247.gb` is plasmid for luciferase-carrying lentivirus backbone

`mutagenesis_primers.csv` contains a spreadsheet with primers used to fill in sites that failed mutagenesis during library construction.

`H5_ssvl_submission_form_230223.xlsx` sslv library design submitted for twist.  

`Q-248900_Final_QC_Report_for_twist_library.xlsx` QC report for ptoduced library.  

`oPool_for_failed_sites_IDT.xlsx` oligo sequences used for in house PCR to introduce some mutations in the sites that have failed during twist design.
