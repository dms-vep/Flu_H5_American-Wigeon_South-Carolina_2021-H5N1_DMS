# H5 deep mutational scanning library design

This sub-folder contains mutations that were designed to be included in this H5 library. The library was ordered from Twist Biosciences. Twist library was designed to have all possible mutations in the H5 except for some stop codons. 

`3403_pH2rU3_ForInd_H5_H5N1_turkey_Indiana_genscript_T7_CMV_ZsGT2APurR.gb` contains the plasmid map for H5 sequence in inducible lentiviral backbone used in deep mutational scanning.  

`H5_ssvl_submission_form_230223.xlsx` sslv library design submitted for twist.  

`Q-248900_Final_QC_Report_for_twist_library.xlsx` QC report for ptoduced library.  

`oPool_for_failed_sites_IDT.xlsx` oligo sequences used for in house PCR to introduce some mutations in the sites that have failed during twist design.
